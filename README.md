Key Features

🔍 Real-Time Object Detection

Uses YOLOv8 to detect vehicles like cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles in each frame.


🔄 Robust Object Tracking

Employs BYTETracker to maintain consistent vehicle identities across frames, ensuring smooth and reliable tracking.


📏 Virtual Line Monitoring

Implements a configurable virtual line to count vehicles and analyze traffic patterns as they cross a defined boundary.


✏ Dynamic Annotations

Annotates video streams with bounding boxes, labels, and trace lines to visualize vehicle trajectories and crossing events.


🎥 Flexible Video Input

Supports both live webcam feeds and recorded video files, making it adaptable to various deployment scenarios.


📡 Hardware Integration for IoT-based Smart Traffic Control

ESP32 with RFID Scanner: Detects RFID tags on authorized vehicles (e.g., emergency vehicles, buses) for priority access.

Raspberry Pi 4B: Runs the machine learning model for real-time processing.

Infrared & Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure vehicle density at intersections to optimize signal timing.

Servo Motors & Relays: Control traffic lights dynamically based on detected congestion.

Wi-Fi & Mobile Hotspot Connectivity: Enables remote data transmission for cloud-based analytics.

How It Works

1. Capture Video & Sensor Data

Frames are captured from a live webcam or video file while the ESP32 collects RFID and sensor data.



2. Vehicle Detection & Tracking

YOLOv8 detects vehicles, while BYTETracker ensures smooth tracking.

RFID module detects authorized vehicles, triggering smart traffic control responses.



3. Traffic Flow Optimization

AI-based decision-making adjusts traffic signals based on congestion levels and emergency vehicle detection.

Real-time data visualization provides insights for urban traffic planning.



4. Cloud Integration (Optional)

Data can be sent to a cloud dashboard for long-term analytics and smart city monitoring.
